# My WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge Submission

This playground was designed and developed by **Duraid Abdul**.

**Abstract:** As a developer, student and musician, I have always valued sleep as a way to stay sharp and active throughout the day. Sometimes it's easy to forget how important sleep is, and I've created this playground to demonstrate my idea for a simple and interactive way to educate people on the topic. I hope you enjoy my playground and learn something new!

**Accessibility:** This playground was designed to be used by everyone, and supports accessibility features offered by iOS, including:
 - Small and large text sizes
 - Voice Control (e.g. "show names")
 - VoiceOver

**Coding Conventions:**
 - This project uses the prefix SLP for all UIKit classes, and no prefix for SwiftUI views and additional source files.
 - UI controllers, components and models have been split into modular, highly reusable components, as documented in Chapter 1.
